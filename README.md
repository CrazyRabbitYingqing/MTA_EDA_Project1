# MTA_EDA_Project1

The NYC DOT and MTA transit system wanted to construct several new stations to satisfy the growing post-pandemic daily public transit needs. The goal of this project was to use Numpy and Pandas to clean and analyse the MTA subway transit data to come out a survey plan to help determine the best locations for new stations. I worked with with data from the MTA website between April 2021 and October 2021 to extract the busy level of each station and different time blocks for further analysis. After cleaning and analysing the data, I plot several bar plot to visualize and communicate my results using Seaborn. Finally, I came out a preliminary Survey plan for the client.
